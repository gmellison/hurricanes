  Greg:
    Working on CMORPH precipitation data (since 2002)
    Added HURDAT2 nicely formatted 
      TODO: 1. add readme , 2. daily aggregates


  Hyunseok:
    looking for Japanese data
    found from 2001-present
    will translate into english

Data Issues:
  1. Variable time ranges -- daily summaries are sufficient
  2. different schemas in data from different sources
 
  Maintain raw data, add summary for daily(?) aggregations
